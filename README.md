## Mean Normalisation and Data separation

Mini project as part of Udacity AI programming with Python

Mean normalization, scaling data by distributing the values evenly in some small interval around zero.

Separation of data into 3 sets, uses random permutation.
1. A Training Set - 60% of the data
2. A Cross Validation Set - 20% of the data
3. A Test Set - 20% of the data

## numPy Learning

Jupyter notebook of numPy functions and methods.
